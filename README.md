# Graph Construction based on Degree Sequence

## Introduction

We intend to construct all non-isomorphic graphs from a particular degree sequence. You can explore results inside `figures` directory.

## Setup

On Ubuntu operating system, just run `setup.sh`, and then you can launch *JupyterLab*

```bash
jupyter lab
```

or *Jupyter Notebook*

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

to explore the project.

**Note**: If you have installed new dependencies, please freeze them into `requirements.txt` for future use:

```shell
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
